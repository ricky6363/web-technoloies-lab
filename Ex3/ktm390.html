                The new design features a 2-piece construction composed of an all-new steel trellis main frame with a pressure die-cast aluminum subframe. The rear shock absorber is now also mounted off-center to allow for a larger airbox while reducing seat height and, at the same time, adding to the DUKE's aggressive stance. Not only designed for looks, the primary objective of the frame design is to enhance vehicle dynamics by augmenting torsional rigidity, improved agility, and enhanced feedback from the chassis.

                Thanks to a slightly longer wheelbase, new seat heights, and frame geometry, the 2024 DUKE range boasts dramatically improved cornering behavior, stability, and handling proficiency. This, along with an already sterling reputation as being a THE CORNER ROCKET and an aggressive seating position, means the 2024 KTM 390 DUKE sets the standard when it comes to energetic NAKED machinery.
